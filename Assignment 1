Damping Ratio (ζ - Zeta):

ζ = 0 (Undamped):
Pure oscillations.
No energy loss, never settles.
Theoretical; not practical.

0 < ζ < 1 (Underdamped):
Oscillatory response with overshoot.
Fast reaction but with ringing.
Common in systems needing speed (e.g., motors, drones).

ζ = 1 (Critically Damped):
Fastest response without overshoot.
No oscillation.
Ideal for systems requiring stability and speed (e.g., suspension).

ζ > 1 (Overdamped):
No overshoot.
Very slow to reach steady state.
Used in precise or sensitive systems (e.g., measurement devices).

Natural Frequency (ωₙ):
Higher ωₙ (Natural Frequency):
Faster system response.
Reduced rise and settling time.

Lower ωₙ:
Slower system dynamics.
Longer time to settle or respond.

Combined Effect (ζ + ωₙ):
High ωₙ, Moderate ζ (~0.7):
Fast and stable response.
Minimal overshoot, widely desired.

High ωₙ, Low ζ (< 0.5):
Very quick response.
High overshoot and oscillations.

Low ωₙ, High ζ:
Very sluggish response.
No overshoot, but may be too slow.

System Behavior Summary:
More damping (↑ζ) → Less overshoot, slower response.

Less damping (↓ζ) → More overshoot, more oscillation.

Higher frequency (↑ωₙ) → Faster response.

Lower frequency (↓ωₙ) → Slower response.
